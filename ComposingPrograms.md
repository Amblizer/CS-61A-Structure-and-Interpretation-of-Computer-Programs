## 1.1 Start

1. Priciples: beauty, simplicity and readability

2. Definitions:
    - Statements: codes usually describe actions
    - Expressions: codes do computations
    - Functions: a box of series of statements and/or expressions
    - Objects: data and its unalienable properties
    - Interpreters: to evaluate compound expressions in a predictable way

    >functions are objects, objects are functions, and interpreters are instances of both.

3. Expect errors:
    - Debugging: know error itself and dignose it
    - Priciples of debugging:
        - Test incrementally, identify probles early and easily
        - Isolate errors, localise according to output
        - Check assumptions, make sure assumptions check with codes precisely
        - Peer consulting, chart of valuable community

>The fundamental equation of computers is:

>computer = powerful + stupid

>Programming is about a person using their real insight to build something that the computer can do.
